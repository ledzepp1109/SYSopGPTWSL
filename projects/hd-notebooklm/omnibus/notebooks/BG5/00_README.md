# Notebook: BG5

Goal: extract BG5 concepts and how they derive from (or diverge from) core Human Design mechanics.

## Extraction prompts (copy/paste)

1) List all BG5-specific terms and how they map onto standard HD terms (or don’t).
2) Extract any algorithmic differences from HD (inputs/outputs and naming).
3) Identify what a BG5 report generator needs:
   - data tables
   - interpretations blocks
   - formatting requirements
4) Draft a minimal open-source spec: modules, data formats, and test strategy.
