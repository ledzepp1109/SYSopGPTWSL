# Notebook: TYPES_STRATEGY_AUTHORITY

Goal: extract the mechanical derivation rules for **Type, Strategy, Authority, Profile** and closely related constructs.

## Extraction prompts (copy/paste)

1) Derive the decision tree for Type from bodygraph data (which centers/channels determine which type).
2) Define Strategy and Authority as software outputs:
   - exact conditions (boolean predicates)
   - priority rules when multiple conditions appear
3) Extract Profile computation:
   - where do the two line numbers come from?
   - how do Personality vs Design computations differ?
4) Produce a set of test vectors:
   - list at least 20 charts with expected outputs (type/strategy/authority/profile).
5) Identify required upstream calculations (ephemeris, gate/line mapping, time zones) and link to notebook sections that describe them.
