# Notebook: CORE_TEACHINGS

Goal: extract **definitions + axioms** that other derivation notebooks depend on.

## Extraction prompts (copy/paste)

1) Build a glossary: define each term, synonyms, and “must not confuse with…”.
2) Extract “rules of the system” as if writing software:
   - Inputs, outputs, invariants, edge cases.
3) Identify any places the text implies formulas/tables (e.g., gates/lines mappings) and list what tables are required.
4) Produce a JSON schema for a “Human Design knowledge graph” (nodes, edges, attributes) suitable for GitHub.
5) List contradictions/ambiguities and what evidence would resolve them.
