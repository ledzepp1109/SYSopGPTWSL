# Notebook: ADVANCED

Goal: extract any additional derivation systems that extend core mechanics (Dream Rave, variables, tones/bases, etc.).

## Extraction prompts (copy/paste)

1) List every “advanced output” a software system may compute (variables, PHS extras, Dream Rave, etc.).
2) For each output, extract:
   - required inputs
   - mapping tables
   - algorithm steps
   - known ambiguities/variants
3) Propose a modular architecture for an open-source implementation (core vs optional modules).
4) Identify “must-have” acceptance tests to avoid silent drift.
