# HD_OMNIBUS_v1

This is the **spec and index template** for the Human Design “mega-source” plan.

The build scripts generate a populated version at:
- `G:\My Drive\Human Design Experiments\Omnibus_v1\HD_OMNIBUS_v1.md`

## Notebook map (recommended)

Because NotebookLM has **no cross-notebook search**, each notebook should include a small shared “Primer” source (definitions + canonical terms) so extraction prompts don’t depend on external notebooks.

Suggested notebooks (aim: **10–15 sources each**, not 860):

1) `CORE_TEACHINGS`
2) `TYPES_STRATEGY_AUTHORITY`
3) `CENTERS_MECHANICS`
4) `INCARNATION_CROSSES`
5) `PHS_NUTRITION`
6) `BG5`
7) `ASTROLOGY`
8) `ADVANCED` (Dream Rave, mystical teachings, etc.)

## Mega-source rule of thumb

- Merge **10–30 PDFs** per mega-PDF, grouped by a single topic.
- Keep every output file under **200MB**; split volumes when near limit.
- For duplicates: prefer **PDF** over **DOC/DOCX**; keep DOC only if it’s the only version.
