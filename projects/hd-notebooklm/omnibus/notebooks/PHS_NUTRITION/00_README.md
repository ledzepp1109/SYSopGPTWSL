# Notebook: PHS_NUTRITION

Goal: extract derivation rules for **PHS Determination/Environment** and how software should compute them.

## Extraction prompts (copy/paste)

1) Derive the computation steps from chart data to PHS outputs (Determination, Environment, etc.).
2) Extract required mappings (e.g., Color/Tone/Base relationships) and represent them as tables.
3) List edge cases and interpretation boundaries (what is “mechanical” vs “advice text”).
4) Generate a validation checklist for a software implementation.
