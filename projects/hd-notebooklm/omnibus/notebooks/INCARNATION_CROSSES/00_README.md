# Notebook: INCARNATION_CROSSES

Goal: extract **Incarnation Cross derivation rules** and a machine-usable mapping strategy.

## Extraction prompts (copy/paste)

1) Derive the algorithm:
   - What inputs determine a person’s Incarnation Cross?
   - How does it relate to Personality/Design Sun/Earth gates and lines?
2) Produce a deterministic naming spec:
   - Cross name normalization rules
   - Variant rules (Right Angle / Juxtaposition / Left Angle)
3) Define data structures:
   - Cross → four gates (+ lines?) mapping
   - Cross → meaning text blocks; which parts are “canonical”
4) Generate unit tests:
   - What known sample charts should map to which cross? List test vectors.
5) List required tables/files to ship in an open-source implementation (and their provenance).
